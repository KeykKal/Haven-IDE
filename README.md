# Haven-IDE
a cutsom IDE made for persona modding purposes

# Important
I wrote this code using several example codes writen <a href="https://github.com/ShrineFox/Atlus-Script-Tools">Atlus Script Tools</a>
so you need to have this file additionally.

# Set up
1.you download and extract both the AtlusScriptTools a the <a href="https://github.com/KeykKal/Haven-IDE/releases">release</a>

2.you open the extracted HavenIDE.exe

3.Get an error message and rickrolled 4 times because i did't have the time and I was to lazy to search for Icons or even make one so i picked a random picture. Jap feels like home.

# Usage
I tried to simplify it but I know shit about Design. People who used the Atlus Script Compiler GUI should actually recognize a few things like the select game  on the top right so to make things simple i just tryed to combine the Atlus Script Compiler GUI with an IDE the only thing that is different is that you don't actually drag and drop the files it sound good so i may add this in a future update or something like that.
a thing about this IDE that I don't like is that you have to manually Decompile, then open the decompiled files and if you are finished you need to compile them it may seem quite normal but lets be honest this thing needs to be useful somehow right? I don't feel like I gave a good Introduction here so if you have questions about this then don't be afraid to ask me on anything you can find me on but be aware I may answer a bit late
