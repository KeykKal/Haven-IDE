# Change The Library folder
if you have modded persona before or atleast persona 4G, chances are you also have used the Atlus script compiler and know about the Library folder which in basic terms "makes" the language, well it is a bit more complicated than this but it explains the point that you probably want to update the Library if there it gets update or something similare.
in the IDE's case the Library is in the same folder as the executable so it shouldn't be hard to find.

# Usage
I tried to simplify it but I know shit about Design. People who used the Atlus Script Compiler GUI should actually recognize a few things like the select game  on the top right so to make things simple i just tryed to combine the Atlus Script Compiler GUI with an IDE the only thing that is different is that you don't actually drag and drop the files it sound good so i may add this in a future update or something like that.
a thing about this IDE that I don't like is that you have to manually Decompile, then open the decompiled files and if you are finished you need to compile them it may seem quite normal but lets be honest this thing needs to be useful somehow right? I don't feel like I gave a good Introduction here so if you have questions about this then don't be afraid to ask me on anything you can find me on but be aware I may answer a bit late
